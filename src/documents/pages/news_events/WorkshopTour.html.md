Commencing 24th June 2013 - book now to secure your place

Following on from our successful webinar series on Research Data Management and Long Term Storage and Access to Research Data, a number of Universities have asked Arkivum to hold a Data Storage and Preservation workshop session at their institution.  At each session we share with you our experience of working with Universities, JANET, HEFCE and industry groups, and discuss the different ways forward including:

+ Data Storage Management: How do you cater for the ever increasing amounts of data being generated?  What people, process and infrastructure is needed?  How will you scale up?

+ Research Data: Why keep it? What do the funders expect?  How can you support access and sharing of data?  How can compliance be met for confidential or commercial data?

+ In-house or Outsource: How do you decide?  How can you objectively compare options?  What questions should you ask of the vendors?  How do you avoid lock-in?

+ The Costs.  What are the costs of curation, preservation, storage and access?  When are they incurred and how do they change over time?  Who pays?  How to build a business case and can you do so within the budget available to you?

We’re now extending our UK tour to include other Universities.

We’re familiar with the concerns that different stakeholders will have, including researchers, library, IT and governance – so make the most of this opportunity to bring everyone together at your institution and pick our brains on data preservation, archiving and access.

The Tour commences 24th June 2013 across the UK. Don’t miss out!
