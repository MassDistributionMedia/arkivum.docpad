## Didcot, Oxfordshire and Chippenham, Wiltshire – 14 January 2014 

Janet, part of the Jisc Group, is today announcing a framework agreement with Arkivum Ltd for the provision of “Data Archive to Tape” as a service to provide fast and cost-effective archiving for research and education.
The Agreement covers purchases of Arkivum’s digital archiving service by Higher Education institutions, Further Education and Specialist Colleges and Research Council establishments in the UK, and by any other bodies whose core purpose is the support or advancement of further or higher education or research. It allows all qualifying organisations to procure the archive service quickly without the administrative overhead and costs of an EU compliant competitive tender.
Dan Perry, Director of Product and Marketing at Janet said, “Long term cost effective data storage is increasingly a key issue for research and education organisations and to support our sector we have run a competitive OJEU compliant procurement. The outcome is the framework has been awarded to Arkivum. In addition to demonstrating a good understanding of the challenges facing organisations from the data bonanza, one of the many benefits of the Arkivum archiving service is the fast implementation and speed to ‘go live’.” 
Jim Cook, CEO Arkivum commented, “We are delighted to have this framework agreement in place with Janet. Based on this agreement, institutions will be able to make the most of a well understood and used process, and know that they are getting competitive and pre-negotiated education prices based on the total size of the community and not just the size of their particular institution.”
