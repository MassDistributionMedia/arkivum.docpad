Storage solutions optimised for long-term retention of research data can have significantly lower cost and higher levels of data safety compared to the types of storage that are needed to support the original creation and analysis of that data. This makes archival storage solutions attractive to Universities looking to store ever increasing volumes of research data for the long-term. The result is the need to integrate archival storage with the rest of the RDM process, including systems such as institutional repositories, data access portals, and services for persistent identifiers such as DOIs. This webinar looked at how archive storage can be integrated with institutional repositories and open access, including the people involved in the request/review/approve/restore/deliver processes of getting research data to users within and outside of an institution.       

This webinar was run by Matthew Addis, CTO, Arkivum and Wendy White, Head of Scholarly Communications at the University of Southampton.
