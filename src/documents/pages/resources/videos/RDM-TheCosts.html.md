This is the third webinar in our Research Data Series, to discover the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of research data retention and understand how to estimate, manage and reduce costs With research council and other regulatory requirements dictating decade retention periods or longer, along with a push for open access to research datasets, the cost-effective storage and access to research data is becoming a high priority.   Digital preservation is an essential part of Research Data Management and requires a very much an active approach with ongoing costs that include people, facilities, equipment, maintenance, upgrades, migrations, training and support, self-assessment and audits, and procurement of new systems to name but a few.
