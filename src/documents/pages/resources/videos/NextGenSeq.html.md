Following on from the sequencing of the human genome, DNA sequencing efficiency has increased by approxi­mately 100,000‑fold. Next Generation Sequencing technologies can now sequence the entire human genome in a few days, and this capabil­ity has led to new projects that are aimed at sequencing the genomes of individual humans and a broad swath of animal and plant species.

Today, the cost of clinical whole-genome and targeted sequencing tests is no longer prohibitive to their application. However, the sheer volume of data being created by current and future Next Generation Sequencing technologies threatens to overwhelm existing data storage infrastructures, slowing research productivity and dramatically increasing storage costs. To stay ahead of this data growth and to maximize the value of this mission-critical information, research organisations must be able to efficiently store, secure, access and analyse this data at an unprecedented rate.

Arkivum A-Stor ‘100% guaranteed’ digital archiving service is specifically targeted at Next Generation Sequencing, where organisations have long term data archive requirements for a whole range of digital data types, including images, research data and records. Compliance driven industry regulations concerning electronic documentation (e.g. UK Data Protection Act, MHRA “Guidance on Archiving” (March 2006) and ICH’s Good Clinical Practice), mean that safety, security and accessibility are integral parts of the A-Stor digital archiving service, and these make it an obvious choice for a long term data storage solution.

##  Presentation

In this presentation (see the PDF you can download from this page), Arkivum CTO, Dr Matthew Addis covers the challenges, questions and issues surrounding the long term preservation of data for Next Generation Sequencing research organisations. It provides key information and describes how Arkivum provides a ready-made solution to data retention that is safe, secure, easy to access and available in both cloud and on-site configurations. 

Topics covered include:

+ What does it really take to keep sequencing data accessible for a decade or longer? 
+ What are the risks to long-term safety and security of data when using IT storage systems and the people and processes that surround them? 
+ What do you need to know about storage that the vendors aren't telling you - and what questions should you be asking them? 
+ How do you mitigate the risks, how much will it cost, and what sort of skills do you need to put it all into practice? 
+ And how does all this fit with meeting regulatory compliance?
