In this topical webinar, Karen Redding of Phlexglobal presents the current eTMF industry status and how eArchiving is not being addressed; Eldin Rammell of Rammell Consulting explains why an eArchiving strategy is so important, especially in light of the EMA TMF Reflection Paper and proposed EU Clinical Trial Regulation, the benefits and the various approaches; and Matthew Addis of Arkivum talks about the challenges of meeting regulatory requirements and how to meet these challenges through an active archiving strategy. As a summary, Karen explains the collaboration between PhlexEview, (Phlexglobalâ€™s eTMF) and the Arkivum offering to provide an effective long-term e-Archiving solution.
