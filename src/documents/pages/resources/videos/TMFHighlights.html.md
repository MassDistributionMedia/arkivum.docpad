In September 2012 the MHRA, published its GCP Guide, which provides a valuable insight into the MHRA’s expectations for document management and two chapters that specifically focus on ‘Key Trial Documentation’ and ‘The Trial Master File and Data Archiving’.

Covering all aspects of the record lifescycle, including the compliance challenges of long-term data archiving, this webinar will helps you to understand just what the Guide's key TMF highlights are, along with some “not-to-be-missed” recommendations.
