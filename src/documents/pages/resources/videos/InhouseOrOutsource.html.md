This, the second in our Research Data Management Webinar Series explores the pros and cons of Research Data Management using in-house or outsourced solutions, with an emphasis on long-term data retention and access. 

Research Data Management is a complex activity where the long-term ability to retain, find, retrieve and use research data is a jigsaw puzzle of issues including metadata, formats, storage, policy, training, cultural change and much more.    Some parts of the puzzle are best done in-house in close collaboration with researchers, library and IT and some parts of the puzzle can be outsourced to save time and money, gain access to external expertise, and to reduce risk. 

But how do you decide?   How can you objectively compare options?   What questions should you ask?   Whether looking at a specific in-house solution or considering the services of a third-party provider, being sure that you can 'get out' as easily as you can 'get in' is a key strategy.  Outsourcing offers a lot of promise, including the ability to save cost or to free-up precious in-house resources that could be redirected at more core activities.   But for long-term retention of research data, risk reduction and better access to data are also key drivers.   If you choose either the in-house or outsourcing routes then how can you audit that data is in good hands and best practice is being followed?  How do you know it’s safe and secure, and how do you know that whatever happens you won’t be left high and dry?

In this webinar, Neil Beagrie from Charles Beagrie Ltd and Matthew Addis from Arkivum Ltd weigh-up the options with the aim of helping you decide.
