## Oscar is the 100% safe archiving solution within a corporate firewall

Arkivum is an established provider of cloud based archiving through our A-Stor Enterprise service, but we recognise that many organisations are unable to make the transition to using offsite cloud services due to the confidentiality and regulatory issues associated with their data. For those who want to keep all data within the boundaries of their organisations, OSCAR (On-site Cloud ARchive) offers a 100% safe and secure archiving solution within the corporate firewall.
The ‘all in one’ pod solution, which incorporates a tape library and server running Arkivum’s A-Stor, is located ‘on-site’ on the customer’s premises, either within a private data centre or alongside other customer IT infrastructure in a co-location facility.

## OSCAR / Every bit secure

Building on our deep knowledge of long-term data preservation, OSCAR incorporates best practice in media and data management, together with Arkivum’s A-Stor software providing easy access and sophisticated data integrity and availability management. Arkivum can remotely manage the pod for you over a secure link with no access to the stored data, or the pod can be fully managed by you. System alerts can be channelled both to Arkivum and to your systems administrators.
Arkivum provides full process specifications that describe how to operate the Pod, together with full training on the physical aspects of running the archive to ensure your staff are able to handle tape media safely. In addition, Arkivum supplies pre-verified media that is tracked using RFID technology to ensure tape integrity is maintained at all times.Arkivum’s Enterprise service uses a ‘three-copy’ approach with active integrity checking to ensure no data loss and this underpins our 100% guarantee of data integrity. OSCAR can be deployed with the same three-copy approach, with two Pods and an offline copy, which provides you with the same degree of data safety, security and availability.
