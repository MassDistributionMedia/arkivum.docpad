With A-Stor you can guarantee your data is safe, guarantee your data is secure and take control of your storage budget.Organisations are struggling to cope with the increasing need to manage and retain large amounts of data. With requirements far outpacing budgets, the search is on fora scalable, reliable and flexible solution.Against this background Arkivum has taken a fresh look at how data is managed and created a service that relieves organisations from the many issues surrounding effective long term digital preservation, freeing up time, space and infrastructure currently dedicated to in-house storage.Arkivum will store your data for 25 years, 100% guaranteed data safety.

## A-Stor / Every bit secure

No ifs, no buts, no nines, just 100% pure data integrity. We fully understand that IT systems are never infallible, yet an ever increasing amount of data is stored on them and for ever-longer times. We tackle this problem head-on. We make no assumptions about the safety or security of any component of our system, be it infrastructure, software or people.
We check and double-check data integrity every step of the way. We tightly control access to all aspects of our service. We use sophisticated monitoring to identifyproblems before they occur. These extreme measures allow us to provide absolute assurance that your data is safe and that only you can access it. No other provider offers the same 100% guarantee.

## A-Stor / Every bit considered

### SafeA-Stor holds three encrypted copies of your data at all times, two in automated tape libraries in different geographic locations and one offline in a secure Thirdparty Escrow service. This ensures that your data is safe even if the worst catastrophe should befall our automated services.### SecureSecure UK facilities, ISO27001 policies and procedures, strong data encryption, secure access control, and full audit trails together mean that the Arkivum service meets UK legal requirements for the storage of sensitive data.### Fully managedA-Stor constantly monitors the health of the archive, upgrading and migrating as technology advances to ensure that data held within our service is always fresh and available.
### Easy to accessData is stored in a high availability infrastructure giving quick data access when needed.### Seamless integrationA-Stor acts like any other server on your network. It integrates into your environment, understands permissions and appears to your end users like any other server.### Reduces expenditureFrom reducing your need to buy expensive storage or data management software, through to reducing costs associated with audits and data loss, moving to the Arkivum archiving service makes sound financial sense.
### Increases efficiencyArkivum runs and manages the service, freeing up internal IT resources.### Improves complianceWith Arkivum’s transparent approach to storage, organisations can prove that auditable processes are in place and are being followed. Arkivum offers a 100% guarantee that data placed in the archive is safe and can instantly be searched and retrieved to ensure compliance no matter how far in the future the request is made.### SummaryCurrent storage strategies are unsustainable. Internal solutions are expensive to buy and difficult to manage. Cloud-storage providers offer no guarantees that the data stored will be the data you retrieve. A-Stor is the answer. It’s easy to use, 100% secure and 100% safe. Guaranteed.
