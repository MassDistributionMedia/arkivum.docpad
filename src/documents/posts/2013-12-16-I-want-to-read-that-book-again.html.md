Like many people over the last few years, I’ve invested in an eBook reader and have purchased many books via its online store. All was well until recently when I bought a new book by my favourite author. This new book is now being distributed in a new eBook format that will only be supported by newer eBook devices. While I can read my new book using the eBook software on my Android device, it does then beg the question, 'What about the books on my old eBook device and why should I be forced to upgrade my hardware, particularly when its barely two years old?'. While my eBook collection is only about 30 or 40 books, it would be expensive to purchase them again using another eBook retailer and since I’ve already bought them, why should I? I could consider converting them but there may be copyright or technical issues and the prospect of having my eBook stored with different providers does not thrill me either, especially since there is nothing to prevent this from happening again.
 
This problem then led to a bigger question, 'Do I need an archive strategy?'. Like most people I have data stored both online and offline but how often do I review what is stored, ask if it is still valuable and whether I can still use it? With the growth in cloud storage services, there is even greater need for control of our data, both in terms of protecting it but also in the need to ensure it is still relevant and useful. What do we do about storing data so that it can be used in 5, 10, or even 20 years’ time and how do we determine if our data is important enough to justify the time and expense required to do this. If I had 5,000 eBooks then would I convert them to a neutral format and archive them or convert them every 2 or 3 years when the supporting hardware changes? This would prove to be both expensive and time consuming.
 
In the case of my eBook collection, then I’m faced with the prospect of upgrading my eBook hardware, living with an old device that I can never read a new book on, or moving to different technology, either way there is a financial cost to me in doing any of these things and while the issue that prompted these thoughts is only 30 or so eBooks, if it were my music collection it would cost thousands. So the question remains when should I start to worry about my data and when do I need a strategy.
 
I’m not sure I yet know what the answer is but I do know that a strategy has become much more important as we move to an online world as is the need to protect the investment I’ve made in my data. One thing I do know is that while I need to be sure my data is secure, I also need to be sure that I can read it in 5 years’ time when I need to.
