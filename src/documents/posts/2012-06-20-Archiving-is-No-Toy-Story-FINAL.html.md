With data becoming increasingly more valuable and compliance driven regulations at every turn, a plan on how to preserve data that you don’t require regular access to is essential. And let’s be clear here we’re not talking about back-up but archiving. 

Only 10% of the data on enterprise networks is accessed on a regular basis – have you ever wondered what might happen if this data was wiped out, deleted or simply lost? That’s exactly what happened to world renowned animated film-makers Pixar who nearly lost the original the entire animations of blockbuster movie Toy Story 2* after someone mistakenly ran a command that removes everything on the file system.  
The back-up files for the previous month had failed to run and yes that’s right ‘to infinity and beyond became a stark reality’ rather than the motto used by the infamous Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear. Fortunately for Pixar the copies were located on the home PC of an employee who had been spending a considerable amount of time working from home but this often isn’t the case. 

Had Pixar implemented an effective archiving service much of the ensuing panic which followed the depression of the delete key could have been avoided. Archiving provides enterprises with a highly effective way to store data that isn’t constantly being accessed whilst freeing up space on existing systems notwithstanding the significant cost and environmental benefits that can be achieved. If you want to learn more about the Pixar experience there’s a neat little animated video which documents the whole story and is definitely worth a watch, see [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=EL_g0tyaIeE).  

With our news pages being continually littered with stories of lost data and expensive lawsuits to boot – the time to plan is now, so whether you need to keep data for one year or 50 archiving offers the perfect option.  [](www.arkivum.com)
