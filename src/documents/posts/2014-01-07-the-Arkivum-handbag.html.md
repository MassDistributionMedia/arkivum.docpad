```For work I carry a rucksack, which is weighted down by pretty much everything. I am just one of those people that carries all sorts of things "just in case".Although some things are required, laptop, keys and ID. Others are classic "I just might need this today" and consist of:•	Power supply - even though I drive to work and don't need it 
•	2 mice - one for normal work, one for spare
•	Batteries
•	Screwdrivers of various types
•	Redbull - in case I need to drive tired
•	Tablets - for headaches etc
•	Video cables - HDMI, thunderbolt
•	Thunderbolt LAN Cables - cheers for requiring these Apple
•	Headphoneswell you get the picture....Now imagine that you can have a bit of magic in the form of a Mary Poppins box fitted to the bag. One that has no weight, almost infinite size and will hold everything you need.I would then be left with my laptop, keys and ID - which makes a much lighter and easier to carry bag. I may even be able to get a fancier and less practical carrying device.This is what A-stor does for your data. It looks like it's all there, so it's easy to locate, but only the most recently accessed stuff is kept on-site. This means you don't need the excess weight of all that data that never changes - no need to worry or back it up.Your servers can be smaller, your backups take less time, yet finding things is much, much easier.So anything that can and will change stays in the bag, or on the server. Anything that doesn't change, and is only needed "just in case" goes in the magic box.Sadly Arkivum don't make handbags, but if we did, every single one we made would have a magic box to put the stuff you want to keep but don't want to carry. Instead, our magic box is inside every A-stor appliance and will just make life easier.
