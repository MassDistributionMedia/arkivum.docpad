Amazon's recent announcement of Glacier has certainly elevated the profile of the global archive storage market. Glacier provides low cost archive storage as a cloud service and is ideal for infrequently used data that needs to be kept for future use or for compliance reasons. Aggressive pricing and the Amazon name mean Glacier is getting a huge amount of press which is great news for the archive industry particularly for companies like Arkivum who specialise is providing data archiving services.  

What Amazon has done is raise awareness of both archiving, as a strategy for dealing with infrequently used data, and the cloud, as an effective way to implement that strategy. Stimulating debate on the benefits of the cloud archiving service can only be beneficial for providers such as Arkivum, having the likes of Amazon recognising the need in the market for safe and secure archiving service adds weight to their message while offering healthy competition. But vendors of in-house archive products can also benefit too, for example by providing new ways to provide offsite copies of data for disaster recovery. Glacier will disrupt the industry, but it's not going to mean instant death for on-site solutions, the end of data tape, or monopolisation of the market as others have suggested. Instead we should all welcome Glacier as an innovation that will help move the archive industry forward for all of us.  

And for those wondering why they should use Arkivum's service and not Glacier, then here's just some of the reasons:

- 	All copies of customer data are held in the UK in secure facilities.
- 	Data safety is part of our SLA and is insurance backed.
- 	All customer data is encrypted before it leaves their network for added security.
- 	Only the customer has access to the keys needed to decrypt their data.
- 	A copy of customer data is lodged with an escrow provider for added piece of mind.
- 	We provide software to allow our service to be used as a local filesystem for ease of use.  

The archive storage market is growing rapidly and Glacier will only accelerate this. There's plenty of space for global providers like Amazon as well as specialist services like Arkivum. Glacier might be cold storage, but it's definitely going to warm things up a bit in the industry!
