desc: Capex Headache – Storage Strategies to Make IT Work Harder
```

A recent report by IDC indicates that companies are being prompted to increase Capital Expenditure (Capex) to cope with a sharp escalation in data storage costs, in response to the ever increasing volume of digital data. As the report suggests raising your Capex budget is not the only solution to managing spiralling storage costs.

The study* analyses the results of a US based survey of 500 storage end users that currently deploy or plan to deploy storage and/or data efficiency technologies in their datacentres as well as the benefits these users were able to gain as a result of implementing these technologies.

The storage efficiency technologies referred to in the report are about squeezing the last drop out of existing storage (getting utilisation levels up, compressing content and removing duplication) but that can add complexity, introduce extra costs, and add management overhead.  Data growth is reaching record levels and this is only likely to increase, so the data storage headache isn’t likely to go away. One of the simplest approaches is to get rarely accessed data off existing storage and archive it onto a service such as Arkivum’s A-stor Enterprise, which is far more suited to long-term cost-effective retention.

Using a ‘storage as a service’ option, like Arkivum, presents an attractive alternative to corporate finance departments. Data can simply be ‘drag and dropped’ into the archive, all the while remaining fully encrypted and actively managed. Scalable storage capacity means that the service can flex and grow to cope with demand all the while using a ‘pay as you go option’ which doesn’t impact the capex budget.

Pay as you go archiving services such as Arkivum (there are others available but none that offer a 100% data integrity guarantee) provide significant economic benefits as an on-going operational expense versus the in-house option which requires a high degree of human input along with a series of large capital equipment investments.  Selecting an opex based strategy such as archiving could save you costly management time, reduce your storage overhead and can always be scaled to meet your data demand.
