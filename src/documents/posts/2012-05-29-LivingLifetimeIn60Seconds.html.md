There's one certainty in long-term data archiving: nothing will stay the same for very long.  Think about trying to store your organisation's core data for 20 years.  Whatever technology you start out with will become obsolete.  Media will deteriorate.  Data volumes will climb.  Staff will move on.  Budgets will become tighter than ever. 

Migration, active intervention and good management is the only cost-effective way to keep data alive and kicking.  It's hard to think 20 years into the future, but run out of money, resources or expertise on the journey, or simply forget to regularly tend to the data, and you are well on the road to data loss. 

So what does 20 years of active archive management look like?  Our starting point is 1PB of data that doubles in size every 3 years and is stored in a library using LTO data tape.  If that 20 years only took the sixty seconds it takes to read this post, then this is what would happen.  Deep breath.  450 tapes would be added every second, bills would need to be paid every 4 seconds, data would be checked every 3 sec, tape drives would be upgraded every 9 seconds, software would be replaced every 15 seconds, new tape libraries every 18 seconds, and staff would move on every 24 seconds!  Phew. 

Stretch it all back out to 20 years and things are still pretty hectic, but at Arkivum we've got the people, processes, infrastructure and most importantly the way of thinking to keep this all well under control.
