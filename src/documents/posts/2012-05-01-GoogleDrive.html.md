desc: The effect Google Drive will have on cloud storage providers.
```

Last week saw the long anticipated arrival of Google Drive which is sure to get cloud storage providers such as Microsoft's SkyDrive, Apple's iCloud and Dropbox quaking in their boots as the technology giant leverages its existing links and stakes its claim in yet another market in its quest for world domination. Those not in the know will call it a cloud storage solution and yes technically it is because it stores your data in the cloud but this latest unmanaged method of storing your files is certain to get IT Directors across the land hastily adding it to their list of ‘not permitted’ applications.

Why? I hear you ask – well a closer look at Google Drive’s terms and conditions[1] will reveal exactly why. On acceptance of these terms ‘whilst you still own your content’ you also consent to allowing Google to ‘look at your content’ and so, in theory, it could appear across any of Google’s many applications and search mediums. So incredibly the very issue of data security and probably the over-riding reason that precludes many people from placing their data in the cloud has been completely bypassed.

In short Google Drive is perfect for the standalone user, for example storing family photographs but for the enterprise it’s a whole different ball game. A recent survey[2] of information technology (IT) leaders' views on cloud storage, by Nasuni, an enterprise storage company, backs up this claim. The survey revealed that 81% of IT decision makers have concerns about data security in the cloud, and 48% were concerned about the level of control they would have over data stored in the cloud.

Together, these two concerns were by far the greatest areas of worry for IT professionals when it comes to storing data in the cloud which mean, that for the time being, Google Drive won’t be an enterprise solution. On a positive note what it will do is to help allay the fears many have of keeping data in the cloud whilst doing much to place cloud storage and archiving services firmly on the map.
